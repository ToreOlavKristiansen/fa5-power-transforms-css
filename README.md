Font Awesome 5 "Power Transform" like functionality using straight CSS

## What is this?

Font Awesome 5 provides some really neat functionality they call Power Transforms.
Power Transforms allow you to shrink icons, rotate icons, and layer icons in endless ways.

The problem is, Power Transforms are only available to users of the SVG + JS version of Font Awesome.
At this time, I prefer the web fonts version for performance reasons.

This project attempts to recreate some of the key Power Transform features in straight CSS.
